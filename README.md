# [Project 1: Business Intelligence Dashboard for a Processing Plant at 'X' Industry](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTMyM2FlMjctNjQxZi00NDU5LWFlYTMtMjk5MmQ2N2QyYjYzIiwidCI6ImZlZTNiOTE2LTAxYzEtNDk4Ny1hNjQ2LWUxOTM0MzJiOWVhYSIsImMiOjl9&pageName=ReportSection)
* Created a BI dashboard which tells the working performance of every machine on a single screen.
* Downtime of every machnie is shown divided into types of faults; Mechanical fault, Electrical Fault or Human Error
* Data of 21 machines is taken for a total duration of 120 days
* Each machine belongs to a particular category
* Data can be filtered through timeline as well as according to category of machines

# [Project 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis on python](https://github.com/MFarazNK/Data-Cleaning)
* Data Cleaning on the "house price prediction" data set
* Libraries used; numpy, pandas, missingno & matplotlib

## Step 1: Initial steps
* Deleted unncessary columns
* Made a user defined function "info" to get get number of nulls and unique values in a column instantly  
* Made a user defined function "ranges" to get minimum, maximum, mean, median and mode in a coloumn instantly 
* Made a column to uniquely identify every row (this is used later)

## Step 2 : Removed data entry errors
* Replaced blank spaces and other data entry errors with null values

## Step 3 : Identified the case of MNAR (Missing Not at Random)  
* Used manobar library to visualize the trend of missing values
* Deleted those specific rows as it was less than 5% of the original data

## Step 4 : Replaced null values with appropriate values
* Used the documentation given with the csv file to understand the relationship between columns
* Used EDA to detect outliers
* Replaced null values with appropriate values
